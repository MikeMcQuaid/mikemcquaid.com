title: I Have Obamania!

I've got a fever and the only prescription is Barack Obama.

I am, like a lot of people in Europe, strangely attracted to the US primaries and the Democratic race in particular (as it is actually still a race).

Hearing Barrack Obama talk is pretty inspirational and I'm not even vaguely a US citizen. He seems one of the few politicians who seems to truly believe in what he says and is capturing the hearts of many of the young voters in the US. Ron Paul was a pretty inspirational guy also and I know the Internet loved him but sadly this doesn't seem to have actually translated into a huge amount of votes.

Personally, I hope he wins as it would be nice to have a US President with a less aggressive foreign policy.

I leave you with a quote that I think is particularly relevant:

> [Obama] said -- and I'm going to paraphrase a little here: think about who I am -- my father was Kenyan; I have close relatives in a small rural village in Kenya to this day; and I spent several years of my childhood living in Jakarta, Indonesia. Think about what it's going to mean in many parts of the world -- parts of the world that we really care about -- when I show up as the President of the United States. I'll be fundamentally changing the world's perception of what the United States is all about.
