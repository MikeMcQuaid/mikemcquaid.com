link_title: Software engineers should be a little bit cynical
link_description: "A lot of my readers call me a cynic when I say things like “you should do things that make your manager happy” or “big tech companies get to decide what projects you work on”."

I agree with Sean here.
The industry default seems to be "idealistic about engineering, cynical about management".
Things work better if you're a little cynical about both.
