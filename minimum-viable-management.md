Minimum Viable Management is a podcast where Mike McQuaid and Neha Batra talk about the messy, human side of engineering leadership. From one-on-ones and feedback to servant leadership, productâ€“engineering arguments and career growth, they share hard-won lessons from GitHub, open source and startups. Pragmatic, sweary and focused on what actually works, not performative management theatre.

It was inspired by conversations around my writing on
