title: The Golden Compass - What's all the fuss about?
---
The Catholic League in the US has called for a boycott of The Golden Compass, the film based on Philip Pullman's novel Northern Lights.

I had the chance of seeing the film this afternoon and enjoyed it. The story is fairly predictable (in the film anyway) and the trailers I had seen ruined some of the twists and turns for me but this didn't detract overly from my enjoyment of the film. The main reason I went to see it, to be honest, was for the CGI which met far exceeded my expectations. I wish my grandparents were still around so I could show them some of the imagery that we can create with computers now, I think they'd be pretty blown away.

Apparently the novels are a lot more directly anti-Church but this doesn't really seem to come across in the film. From what I've read from Wikipedia even the novels aren't _that_ controversial, being more anti-dogma and encouraging free thought rather than blind adherence to what those in authority tell you. I don't find this to be a negative message really at all, in fact I think it is a good one to give to our children.

When I've worked with children I'm always amazed by those who seem to want kids to stop thinking and just accept what they are told. This is the way to mental stagnation and the decline of the sciences and, ultimately, halting the advances in our society.

I want to try and read the books for myself rather than relying on second-hand summaries but, as far as I can see, Philip Pullman doesn't attack my faith but he challenges me to form my own beliefs rather than relying on others to find the answers for me. There was another guy who liked to criticise and rebuke the guys in authority around 2007 years ago. It's his birthday soon.
