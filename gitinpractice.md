An opinionated, intermediate/advanced-level Git book by Mike McQuaid.

Available to read freely at [MikeMcQuaid/GitInPractice on GitHub](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPractice#git-in-practice).

It takes a lot of time from multiple people to write a published book so if this book is useful to you and you can afford it, please consider buying [a paper or ebook copy from Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/git-in-practice?a_bid=5688bbf4&a_aid=MikeMcQuaid).
