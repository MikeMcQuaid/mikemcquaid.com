Hi, I’m Mike McQuaid, the Project Leader for Homebrew and CTPO of Workbrew.

I’ve worked on open source software in some form for 20 years. I got started in a fairly traditional way, using desktop Linux in university in the early 2000s. Through this I ended up helping people out in IRC channels, submitting bugs and then patches on bug trackers and modifying existing software for my own use.
