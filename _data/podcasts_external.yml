  title: Getting Shit Done in Institutions
  description: "<p>David Yee, VP of Engineering at The New York Times and head of
    its new AI platforms and products mission, joins Mike McQuaid and Neha Batra for
    a candid, behind-the-scenes conversation about why institutions are built to resist
    change and what to do about it. They dig into hidden norms, choosing the right
    battles, translating “how things really work” and creating stability for teams
    while you deliberately destabilize the system just enough to move it forward.</p>"

  title: Performance Reviews, Done Right
  description: "<p>Performance reviews have a reputation for being stressful, confusing
    and often disconnected from reality. Too often they surface feedback that should
    have been shared months earlier or reduce a year of work into a single rating.
    In this episode, Mike and Neha unpack why reviews fail and how managers can turn
    them into a useful summary instead of a shock.</p><p></p><p>They explore what
    companies expect from performance reviews, what managers struggle with and what
    employees actually want to hear. The conversation covers documenting early signals,
    balancing positive and critical feedback, avoiding ruinous empathy and ensuring
    no one walks into a review surprised by the outcome. They also discuss practical
    ways to give feedback throughout the life of a project, align on growth goals
    and handle mismatches between perception and reality. A grounded, experience-based
    discussion for anyone responsible for giving or receiving feedback.</p>"

  title: Politics at Work Without Losing Your Soul
  description: "<p>In this episode, Mike and Neha are joined by Denise, an engineering
    leader and former colleague from GitHub and Pivotal, to unpack the reality of
    workplace politics and why ignoring them is not a neutral choice. Drawing on Denise’s
    LeadDev talk and hard-earned lessons from management and senior IC roles, the
    conversation explores political capital, information asymmetry, allyship and the
    idea of “table flips” as a finite currency.</p><p></p><p>Together they discuss
    when to spend influence, when to hold it back and how privilege shapes who gets
    heard. From advocating for promotions to using power responsibly on the way out
    of an organisation, this is a practical and candid look at how to navigate work
    under capitalism without burning out or selling yourself short.</p>"

  title: Creating and Keeping Momentum
  description: "<p>Mike McQuaid and Neha Batra break down how leaders spark momentum
    and keep it steady. They start with clarity of mission, ruthless scope cuts, and
    visible wins in weeks not years. They cover simple not easy systems that reduce
    drag, like milestone slices, anti-goals, handoffs that follow the sun, and temporary
    process as guardrails you later remove. They show why constraints breed creativity,
    how to automate recurring pain, and why teams should target low volatility over
    peak velocity. They close with saying no, letting the right fires burn, and building
    a candid culture through trust and social capital.</p>"

    vs two-way doors”), and how to communicate so people understand not just what
    you decided, but why.</p><p>They also discuss how leaders can empower others to
    show leadership at any level, the real cost of over-meeting, and what it means
    to take ownership when things go wrong.</p>"
