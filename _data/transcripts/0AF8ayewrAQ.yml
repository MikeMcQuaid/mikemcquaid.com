0: Thank you everyone for having me today, this is my first time at the big stage
  in Homebrew,
9: in Homebrew, Fosda. I've been here many years, I love this conference, it's the
  best open source
16: conference in the world, but first time here. So I thought, given this topic is
  potentially
23: contentious, I would get a friend of mine, hopefully make me feel a little bit
  better.
28: So I sent him the screenshot of when this got accepted, and I said, oh, fuck.
  So he congratulated
36: me, which was very kind. He thought nice things about the title, and then unfortunately
  let
43: me down. So hopefully I am not in fact fucked, but if I am, hopefully it is entertaining
  for
49: all of you to watch me, as we say in the UK, die on your arse. Anyway, so some
  important
56: framing, right? We're going to talk about some stuff today, which is pretty fresh,
  like literally
60: some people who have been involved in the story are possibly in the room, and
  I've seen people
66: at FOSVEM, right? So who already has an awareness of what happened with RubyGems,
  even a vague
74: one, right? And who has like strong opinions about maybe who was in the wrong
  and who was in the
79: right? Trick question. But yeah, okay, so a few of us. So what I ask us to bear
  in mind, right? This is not a trial, right? It doesn't really help us to go and
  point fingers, particularly at individuals, actually, because this is mainly a story
  about groups of people, and communities, and open source foundations, and open source
  maintainers, and companies, and all of that interesting stuff, right? And
97: I actually think this stuff gets, particularly when I'm sitting on a stage, and
  people won't be in the room, it's a bit mean, if we start pointing fingers at individuals,
  so I'm just not going to do that. I'm going to try and avoid naming anyone except
  myself, because I'm allowed to be self-deprecating because I'm British.
115: So the next thing, again, I want us to just encourage anyone who right now is
  like, this group with this person, completely fucked this up, and this group of
  this person did everything right. Like, that's a bit of a red flag, right? You know,
  many of us in the room, I'm sure are engineering, right? And this group of this
  person did everything right? Like, that's a bit of a red flag, right? You know,
  many of us in the room, I'm sure are engineering, right? And this group of this
  person did everything right? Like, that's a bit of a red flag, right? You know,
  many of us in the room, I'm sure are engineering, right?
145: We work with engineers, right? And we work with software, and complex systems
  fail in complex ways, right? So if you feel absolutely certain about something,
  that means either you're probably missing something, or maybe you have a bias. That's
  okay. No shame, no shade, whatever, right? But just let's try and try and come into
  this with an open mind, right? Again, another important framing, I think, for all
  this is incentives of everything, right? Like, very rarely
175: in the world do we actually have particularly in things like open source
179: and in workplaces and not Netflix shows or whatever like people who are just
184: unbelievably evil and cackle away as they deliberately do the thing to
187: maximally fuck over as many people as possible right like people are responding
191: to the incentives that are put in front of them right people don't go into things
195: generally with bad intentions and generally the people who we look at in
198: these situations who we think maybe have bad intentions just have a really bad
201: incentive structure set in front of them right so I'm also need to look at
204: things through that lens and we're gonna try this being a lot of I guess the
208: word drama has come up again and again when people have been talking about this
211: right sometimes like favorably sometimes used to critique one side or another
  or
216: whatever but I feel like we thankfully have moved past the drama stage right
  and
222: we can be in the learning stage so let's do that this talk is about free and
  open
228: source software and specifically infrastructure projects which I'll talk a
233: a little bit later on why this is a particularly important topic for me specifically
  but these
240: projects underpin an enormous amount of the internet right like for most even
  kind of
246: commercial software developers who are not here who care nothing about open source
  who probably
249: don't even really understand open source the amount of open source software that
  has to work
253: and go right and be lined up and perfectly orient itself for that person
259: to do their day job and increasingly their day job far removed from technology
264: is pretty breathtaking when you think about it right it's arguably open source
268: software is one of the best achievements we've made as mankind and I love
274: conferences like this because I think it really highlights the kind of beauty
  of
279: what we're doing here right we are creating this worldwide system of
283: software which is incredibly powerful and many people rely on empowers so many
287: other fields right but because it's invisible when it's working and because
292: people don't think about it often it just fades into the background and that
298: success that comes from making things invisible and transparent and just
303: smoothly flowing makes it even more dramatical
306: that's not a word even more dramatic when things fail when things fail they
312: fail loudly they feel globally and the blast radius on important projects it's
316: never small so Ruby gems is one of those systems and that's what the story today
321: it's gonna be about not talking about heroes we're not talking about villains
324: we're just talking about systems of distress and what we can learn so who am
  I
328: why am I talking about this and what can you maybe learn from me firstly I think
334: that's legitimate to ask particularly in something like this story because I
339: think a lot of the people who maybe have a strong opinions like when you
343: understand a bit about their background it's maybe clear why they have the view
347: they have so I'm the project leader of homebrew a Mac package manager it runs
  on
352: Linux and stuff as well so I've worked on that since 2009 so that'll be 17 years
  this
359: year which is slightly terrifying and I think what that does is it gives me a
363: little bit of context about what it's like to run a package manager what it's
367: like to work on these open source projects for long periods of time but we'll
  see
372: later I'm not super involved with this story beyond that right I was a principal
378: engineer at github for a while that told me a fair bit about open source it told
  me a
384: fair bit about Ruby because that's what github is primarily built in and scale
389: security liabilities etc I think most importantly actually for the story I'm
  a
394: Rubyist I first wrote some Ruby in 2005 I've probably written Ruby more than
  any
399: other language since about 2009 and I deeply love it I like the ecosystem I like
403: many of the people I have friends I've met because of Ruby I have jobs that I've
  got
407: because of my work on Ruby and I have depend on it for most of my career finally
413: and somewhat least importantly like I have a day job right open source is not
  my
418: life I'm a CTPO a small training management software company in Scotland but
  as a
424: result of that I have had to do an awful lot of like work around growing as a
430: leader and trying to understand how systems and cultures and incentives are set
  up
435: and what happens right I'm not a Ruby James maintainer I never have been I have
439: similarly with bundler I have no affiliation with Ruby central I've never
443: been involved with them I've never given them any money I've never done any work
447: with them or anything like that in this situation that I was asked to mediate
  so
451: some people we'll talk about later on like the way homebrew does governance was
456: kind of cited relatively early on in this situation and as someone who was kind
  of
460: very involved with with homebrew and our governance process I was asked to
463: kind of come in and see like well how can this apply to Ruby gems or not but
466: unfortunately my mediation did not manage to stop happening what's happened
472: right it's interesting because pretty much this whole story takes place between
477: September and October 2025 we've we kind of have a bit of stability now I think
482: some of the kind of strongest emotions were kind of past that stage which
486: probably helps us to look back a little bit so we're talking about weeks for
  most of
491: these events rather than years although the context set beforehand and the stuff
494: we'll learn afterwards we'll go back and forward I help gems that co-op you don't
500: need to know what that is if you don't already and I help them kind of set up
  their governance
504: process I learned some stuff along the way so okay who knows what Ruby gems is
  hand up
511: okay most people so I'll keep this brief rubies package manager is Ruby gems
  it's technically you
519: could use another package manager but that's the main default that the vast majority
  people use it was
524: actually founded in 2004 and after Ruby had been around for a fair wee while
  like
530: nowadays often the software kind of comes with version can version locking and
  package
535: management along with the language right out the door but that was not the case
  with Ruby gems and Ruby
540: there's millions of applications that are on Ruby gems and as a result it's we're
  not talking about some
546: niche tool used by a few people we're talking about kind of critical infrastructure
  on the internet
550: which brings up things like software supply chains and all these other kind of
  big grown-up selling
555: words it's not side project as well right many open source projects are essentially
  run by one person in their evenings and weekends they never get any money for it
  they never spend any money on it and it's just like a fun little hobby but Ruby
  gems is not in that category Ruby gems is much more critical
572: so money money money is messy particularly when you involve it with open source
  who feels a little bit uncomfortable talking about money sometimes
582: yeah quite a lot of people and like open source money is even more potentially
  uncomfortable
588: because well some things cost money servers cost money storage cost money bank
  with the cost money
595: on coal if you want to pay someone well sorry if you want someone to be woken
  up at three o'clock in the morning
601: on a regular basis when stuff breaks then generally you need to provide a bit
  more incentive to that
608: than just peer pressure and community goodwill
611: incidents cost money and if you've got years of work you can have it undone in
  a few hours when you have some critical incident
619: and it's why organizations behave differently under stress
622: because depending on where the money is that tends to focus attention even more
  closely when incidents are going on
629: but not everything costs money
631: let's compare with the open source project I've worked on for a while with homebrew
  right
637: so this is not to say homebrew is better or worse
640: it's just a comparison because I think we're two projects both written in ruby
  but we have a different approach to these things
646: so homebrew's hosting when you download homebrew's binary packages we do not
  pay any money for that
651: because we were originally hosted by sourceforge then bin tray and then nowadays
  it's github
658: so the trade-off for that is that homebrew is not as independent as something
  like rubygems is right like rubygems is not relying on any
665: single vendor like they push their servers on every us but they could move relatively
671: with big finger quotes easily to another provider
675: and probably certainly a lot easier than homebrew could so in some ways we're
  not even independent we're somewhat dependent on retaining in the good graces of
  github right
684: I used to work there I still know a lot of people there so I'm not as worried
  about that as I might be something else but again that may or may not be a decision
  that makes sense for your project or for rubygems
694: so let's quickly scan through the timeline of what happened these events right
  so ruby central the organization that's kind of often cited with this discussion
  was founded originally in 2001 and by a couple of people in the ruby community who
  wanted to provide a permanent nonprofit for running ruby community events and handling
  sponsorship and logistics
719: a few of those same people were involved with releasing rubygems in March 2004
  and then we have to go forward about 11 years before we kind of reach the next group
  that's kind of relevant this story which is ruby together
736: so they were actually announced by ruby central in 2015 and they described their
  purpose as funding on-call rotations maintenance work and improvements to shared
  ruby infrastructure which included bundlers rubygems and rubygems.org which had
  in their words historically been done by volunteers
755: in 2022 these organizations merged and became a single nonprofit described the
  motivation as reducing duplicated nonprofit overhead and unifying community
766: for the events under the events under one roof so this brings us to basically
  the more contentious events right hands up if you were following this live on social
  media when it was going on in 2025
780: right yeah a few people here so September 2025 everything kind of goes down within
  a few weeks right and again i think there's some interesting context when we talk
  about the setup for this taking you know almost 15 years and then within a few weeks
  things radically change
796: so one of the first things i think that happened was control of the main github
  organization which was used by rubygems related projects was changed in a way that
  restricted or removed access for some of the people who are maintaining rubygems
  and this came out of some folks who were involved with ruby central that also involved
  reading the github organization from rubygems to ruby central and essentially there
  was as far as
826: as various people involved various people involved are concerned some people
  say this was very long time coming and this should have been expected and other
  folks felt completely blindsided by what happened
835: there wasn't certainly any public notice of this people had some sort of behind
  the scenes warnings that something might be happening but certainly a bunch of people
  were as i said essentially blindsided by what happens and the problem with this
  is when you make decisions quickly and when you deliver them somewhat abruptly that
  always tends to
856: you feel hostile right it feels it can feel malicious it can feel difficult it
  can feel targeted even if it wasn't necessarily intended that way
863: and particularly in open source when we assume so much stuff is going to be done
  in the public when there's no public communication at all then it can make this
  very hard
871: there was also essentially no governance process so i mentioned before homebrew's
  governance process we'll talk a little bit about that later but essentially at the
  time when this was all going on there wasn't a documented process about how people
  get added to how people get added to how people get
886: and removed who controls what which non-profit is responsible for what what taking
  money means as a contractor or an employee or whatever with this organisation and
  the problem is when you don't have a written governance structure then whoever holds
  power ends up filling the gap and getting to make the decisions
905: so after the initial shock we had an attempt at recovery right it looked like
  things were going okay to begin with so we got to mid-september there was multiple
  possible futures it looked like maybe we could get everything back everyone could
  get back on the same page there might be some hurt feelings but we'll be okay there
  was a governance PR proposed on september the 14th
927: and you can go and see the url show on the screen in a few slides where you can
  see the kind of conversation that was going back and forth this is how I kind of
  ended up getting pulled in as well because it was based off homebrew's governance
  and then I was I kind of offered to give some input there and then got pulled into
  mediation as well
942: and then shortly afterwards the access was restored for most of these people
  right so if you go to the PR you can kind of see how this went on and like the sort
  of tick-tock of what was going on in the event right
957: so then by September the 18th we get to a point where I've offered to kind of
  step in and mediate between both sides there's a lot of private conversations going
  on a lot of private contacts going on and in public it looks good it looks like
  we're both sides are discussing governance and then we get to the point the access
  gets removed again for a bunch of people right and this is when things get a little
  bit messier because some folks who had their access removed
982: and then claimed that it was a mistake that their access had been removed and
  then others took offense and essentially things get very messy very quickly right
  and then trust just gets destroyed and never really rebuilt this is when we start
  to get security concerns invoked as a justification as well there was mention of
  supply side security which in recent history there have been NPM supply side security
  attacks so RubyGems having a relatively similar trust model
1012: like that was concerning to people being involved it also concentrated power
  very quickly and made clear who had power to do what and who was citing these concerns
  and using them to make what decisions
1026: so by the time we get to late September we have another inflection point where
  it becomes public on the 28th of September the root level infrastructure access
  still existed outside the new control structure
1039: so the people who were maintainers and had either been removed from the project
  or had quit the project in protest at the changes some of them still had AWS access
  and AWS root access even more severely right
1053: so again this back and forth about exactly who had what access and when why
  and what this meant but essentially regardless this is a bad situation right you
  have a situation where the theoretical control of the project and the actual control
  of the project are diverging pretty far right
1068: and then essentially there was a lot of back and forth but eventually we reached
  the end state where almost a month later in October the 17th RubyGems and Butler
  moved to the Ruby core team so essentially Ruby central who had taken ownership
  of these projects then gave ownership elsewhere and then the people who had been
  existing maintainers of RubyGems declared that they were happy with that and they
  were going to allow things to move on
1094: So you can see you can read the route access event this has got kind of Ruby
  central's take of like what went down with the AWS access and stuff like that this
  was posted on the 9th of October
1107: and then while this is all going on it gets to the point where there's enough
  drama that like various parts of the tech press started reporting on it and people
  are getting quotes blog posts social media press coverage essentially take over
1123: we're not having really any discussions on PRs anymore this is all happening
  out in the open and then the narrative stops being controlled by the people who
  are just involved and things become a little bit reactive
1134: people start raising privately a lot of people in the Ruby community people's
  confidence drops like what does this mean for RubyGems is RubyGems still going to
  be running anymore and worst of all lawsuits begin like we have again publicly on
  the record both sides have talked about how they've engaged in legal action with
  the other high
1153: we have no insider knowledge as to what the statuses of said lawsuits but I
  think it's relatively predictable that once that happens people are no longer interested
  or able really to make good and be friends with people they are in lawsuits with
  at that point
1168: so what were the consequences what happened here well talk failed pretty quickly
  right so people tried to voice what was going on and how they were feeling and how
  they could improve things but then when people get kicked out the project then all
  of that just becomes public discussion instead of private discussion
1187: so a bunch of maintainers exit the project some people removed against their
  will and then some people removed protest so you get to the point where the majority
  of people who are working on RubyGems in the space of two months essentially have
  left and gone and done their own thing
1204: so doing their own thing what does that means well there was a single gem co-op
  which some of the maintainers went off and decided to build so they essentially
  built their own alternative to RubyGems both centralized service and they have forks
  of various other projects and stuff as well so this was not an overnight replacement
  but it was spun up relatively quickly and it built essentially a separate kind of
  side ecosystem which changed the power
1234: landscape right so forks don't need to necessarily win or get more users to
  matter and in this case I think this kind of sent a message about how things could
  be done differently and it also made clear that that group of people were not interested
  in re-entering the fold again
1248: so another interesting kind of consequence of this is I guess what I would call
  professional open source so what I mean by that is we have a bunch of people in
  this room I would guess probably the majority of people in the room how many people
  are paid to do open source work for
1264: primarily at the job okay I guess if you look around the room everyone that
  is the minority right and I would say in the open source community in general it
  is in the minority right so when you have people whose full-time salaried work is
  focused primarily on open source and when they have bosses and leaders and HR teams
  and their mortgage depends on them making those people happy then the incentives
  are radically different right and it introduces different incentives to what exists
  before when you have volunteers
1294: working in their free of time and also you have the blurring between the two
  where you have people taking contracts and doing paid work on open source they might
  not be an employee but they have agreed to some sort of transactional relationship
  in exchange for money
1307: and that makes things hard and this is even more tricky when you have a project
  like rubygems which is already hard because you're running critical open source
  infrastructure and it requires many skills outside of writing code right which is
  sometimes the easiest skill to be able to get from the community in open source
1325: because what this means is that volunteers have their limits and people run
  out right so what does this mean for careers right so a bunch of the people involved
  in this story had at some point been paid either full-time or part-time or were
  full-time employees of ruby central or ruby together or whatever it may be well
  my potentially contentious take is open source is not a career right and by that
  I don't mean those
1355: you said it's your full-time job to work on open source I don't mean that you
  somehow don't have a job and you're in a haze and don't really know where you are
  what you're doing like obviously some people do have that but most of us don't open
  source can be part of your career and even those folks I imagine who are working
  full-time open source I would imagine your day-to-day looks pretty different to
  how it did if it was just your evenings and weekends right it's a very different
  way of working and I don't think we help our community by making out that the way
  you work
1385: worked before you received any money can just be paid a bay area salary without
  any change to it so I think we also need to plan for our exit as individuals and
  as organizations and exit of funding and all these types of things right we need
  to plan for the transitions that are going to happen even when they're deeply uncomfortable
1404: because ultimately one size does not fit all every project is going to ebb and
  flow and change the years
1411: and context is everything so what can we learn from all this well as I said
  at the beginning it's not about blame
1418: right we need to not blame because it just simplifies and polarizes and it prevents
  learning
1423: if you're 100% sure about who's right who's wrong
1426: then that's going to feel good maybe for you but it's not going to explain very
  much
1430: governance and open source is really boring
1433: until it's not
1435: and at that time it's probably too late to introduce it
1439: okay maybe money entering the equation makes things better
1443: but it certainly makes things a lot more complicated
1446: and we should think really carefully about how
1448: and when and why you introduce money to the open source project
1450: let's all not focus on who was right and who was wrong
1454: not who messed up
1455: but instead just try and ask better questions
1458: let's ask about what broke and why it broke
1460: and not who did what
1461: and then we can learn something about governance or money
1464: right if your project hasn't argued about governance or money yet
1467: it probably will one day
1469: be prepared and try and do this stuff before it becomes a problem
1472: and that's the transferable lesson
1474: if you've got questions then come and speak to me outside
1476: you can email me or you can find how to contact me other ways on my website
1480: thank you very much
1490: Thank you.
