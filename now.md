Updated July 7th, 2025, from my home in Edinburgh, Scotland.

#### Work

I’m currently focused on my fractional CTO/CTPO and Principal Engineer consulting work.

I left my full-time role as CTPO at Workbrew but continue in a fractional role as Homebrew Fellow and Advisor.

#### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

I continue to lead and contribute to Homebrew, which I will have maintained for 16 years as of September 2025.

#### Exercise

I'm enjoying [powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/mikemcquaid) again, especially as a Masters 1 lifter.

#### Reading

I continue to avoid reading the [news and social media]({{ '/how-i-procrastinate-less/' | absolute_url }}) focusing instead on books.
I [mostly read](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mikemcquaid) hard science fiction, space opera, fantasy and the occasional bit of non-fiction.

#### Music

I sadly no longer [play or write music]({{ '/music/' | absolute_url }}), I just don’t have the time.
I still listen to a lot of music, mostly power metal, and have attended a few more gigs than I used to.
I now heartedly enjoy the mosh pit.

#### Games

Gaming is a form of relaxation that works well with parenting as I can do it all at home.
I'm [mostly enjoying](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mikemcquaid/) open world RPGs, Total Warhammer games and being an achievement completionist.

#### Health

I'm healthy and happy.
[Finding a therapist]({{ '/how-to-find-a-therapist/' | absolute_url }}) has helped, and continues to help, with that.

#### Family

My wife and children remain wonderful and central to my life.
I try to keep details about them off the internet but: ask me about them privately if you want to know more.

#### Pets

I have a cocker spaniel and recently adopted guinea pigs.
It makes me happy and relaxed to stroke them.
