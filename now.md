Updated May 27th, 2024, from my home in Edinburgh, Scotland.

#### [Workbrew](https://workbrew.com)

I left GitHub after 10 years in 2023 to [start a company](https://workbrew.com) with two of my former GitHub coworkers.
We're building "the missing features and support for companies using Homebrew".
It provides vulnerability reporting and mitigation, MDM integration, fleet configuration, remote `brew` command execution and much more.

I'm having a great time.
It's definitely not always easy but it's super rewarding to do a bunch of things I've never done before e.g. leading product, being a manager.

#### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

I continue to work on Homebrew and serve as the Project Leader.
[Homebrew turned 15 years old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY31NQP4JPk) in May 2024 and I'll have been maintaining it for 15 years in September 2024.

#### Exercise

I gave up judo because I kept getting injured.
I'm getting back into [powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/mikemcquaid).
I do [spin classes](https://tribe.yoga/tribe-cycle/) because some cardio is sadly necessary.

#### Reading

I've continued to try to avoid reading the [news and social media]({{ '/how-i-procrastinate-less/' | absolute_url }}) and instead try to read books.
I [mostly read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/37799508-mike-mcquaid?shelf=read&sort=date_read) hard science fiction, space opera and the occasional bit of non-fiction.

#### Music

I sadly pretty much never [play or write music]({{ '/music/' | absolute_url }}) any more, I just don't have the time.
I still listen to a lot of music, mostly power metal, and have attended a few more gigs than I used to.
I will now go in the mosh pit.

#### Games

This is a method of relaxation that works very well with parenting because I can do it all at home.
I'm [mostly enjoying](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mikemcquaid/) open world RPGs, Total Warhammer games and being an achievement completionist.

#### Health

I'm healthy and happy.
[Finding a therapist]({{ '/how-to-find-a-therapist/' | absolute_url }}) has helped and continues to help.

#### Family

My wife and children continue to be wonderful and important to me.
I try to keep details about them off the internet but: ask me about them privately if you want to know more.

#### Pets

I have a cocker spaniel and recently got guinea pigs.
It makes me happy and relaxed to stroke them.
