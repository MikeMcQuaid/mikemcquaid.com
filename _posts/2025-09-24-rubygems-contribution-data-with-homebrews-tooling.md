title: RubyGems Contribution Data with Homebrew's Tooling
---

There's ongoing discussion about recent changes to access in the RubyGems GitHub organisation.
If you need context, first read
[Open Source Turmoil: RubyGems Maintainers Kicked Off GitHub](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-turmoil-rubygems-maintainers-kicked-off-github/).
My goal is to share contribution data to help inform the conversation.

## 🍺 Homebrew Contributions

Hi, I'm Mike McQuaid 👋.
I've spent most of the last 13 years working on Ruby on Rails applications you may have used such as
[GitHub](https://github.com),
[AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com),
[Workbrew](https://workbrew.com),
and [Strap](https://github.com/mikemcquaid/strap).
I've maintained
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (mostly written in Ruby)
for 16 years and have been the Project Leader since the position was created in 2019.
Some of
[my responsibilities](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-Leadership-Responsibilities#project-leader)
include assessing whether
[Homebrew maintainers'](https://github.com/homebrew/brew#who-we-are)
contributions make them eligible for:

- retaining commit access and membership in the [Homebrew GitHub organisation](https://github.com/homebrew/)
- receiving the
  [$300/month maintainer stipend](https://opencollective.com/homebrew/expenses?sort%5Bfield%5D=CREATED_AT&sort%5Bdirection%5D=DESC&searchTerm=maintainer-stipend&direction=RECEIVED)
  (paid quarterly)
- receiving other payments, e.g.
  [hardware grant](https://opencollective.com/homebrew/expenses?sort%5Bfield%5D=CREATED_AT&sort%5Bdirection%5D=DESC&searchTerm=hardware&direction=RECEIVED),
  [travel expenses to the AGM](https://opencollective.com/homebrew/expenses?sort%5Bfield%5D=CREATED_AT&sort%5Bdirection%5D=DESC&searchTerm=travel&direction=RECEIVED),
  [lunch with other maintainers](https://opencollective.com/homebrew/expenses?sort%5Bfield%5D=CREATED_AT&sort%5Bdirection%5D=DESC&searchTerm=lunch&direction=RECEIVED)

This is partly a matter of security
([principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)),
partly a matter of responsible use of
[our funds](https://opencollective.com/homebrew?hostname=opencollective.com#category-BUDGET)
and partly a matter of fair recognition, making "Homebrew maintainer" reflect those doing the actual work.

We built a command for this in Homebrew:
[`brew contributions`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/main/Library/Homebrew/dev-cmd/contributions.rb).
If I run it on myself for the last year, I get this output:

```console
$ brew contributions --user=mikemcquaid --from=2024-09-24 --organisation=Homebrew --csv
mikemcquaid contributed >=100 times (merged PR author), >=100 times (approved PR reviewer), 1787 times (commit author or committer), 35 times (commit coauthor) and >=2022 times (total) after 2024-09-24.

user,repository,merged_pr_author,approved_pr_review,committer,coauthor,total
mikemcquaid,all,100,100,1787,35,2022
```

This means that in the last year I:

- authored >=100 merged PRs
- ✅ reviewed >=100 merged PRs
- authored (I created it) or committed (I modified/rebased/committed it) 1,787 commits
- co-authored (someone accepted my GitHub suggestion) 35 commits

_Note: the >=100 or >=1000 in the output is to make things quicker and avoid hitting GitHub API rate limits._

This excludes actions like commenting on issues, which don't require write access.
Remember: [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

These are the core metrics that I use to evaluate whether someone is maintaining Homebrew.
The tools and data are open.
Also, because we use OpenCollective,
[the money coming into and out of Homebrew is open](https://opencollective.com/homebrew?hostname=opencollective.com#category-BUDGET).

## 💎 RubyGems Contributions

Ok Mike, that's a lot about Homebrew: what about RubyGems?
Sorry, I'm getting to that.

Homebrew has open tooling to analyse GitHub contributions.
RubyGems has a GitHub organisation.
Let's combine the two.

First, who are the owners, maintainers, contributors and members of the RubyGems organisation?
It's not an easy question to answer, so I've built a list based on the people who either participated or were CCd by `indirect` on the
[Proposal for RubyGems Organizational Governance](https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/pull/61).
I've also included the [current members of the RubyGems organisation](https://github.com/orgs/rubygems/people)

I'm not going to make any value judgements about these data.
Remember that
[open source maintainers owe you nothing](https://mikemcquaid.com/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/).

My only observation is that, if I were deciding based on the
[principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)
for access control in the Homebrew organisation, based only on this data and our process, there would be people in all the groups of:

- appear they should have been removed, were removed
- appear they should have been removed, were not removed
- appear they should not have been removed, were removed
- appear they should not have been removed, were not removed

As
[Homebrew's Governance](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-Governance)
has been cited as a good basis, I "stress tested" it here.
I wanted to contribute data to a conversation that currently lacks it.
That’s not to say who should or shouldn’t be in the RubyGems or any other GitHub organisation.

I wish we had data like
[Homebrew's OpenCollective budget](https://opencollective.com/homebrew?hostname=opencollective.com#category-BUDGET)
to similarly analyse finances, but it doesn't seem to be public.

This situation also highlights how funding and transparency can shape open source dynamics.
[I've long believed that money is not the solution to every problem in open source](https://mikemcquaid.com/open-source-economics/).
In some cases, it can create problems that wouldn't exist otherwise.
