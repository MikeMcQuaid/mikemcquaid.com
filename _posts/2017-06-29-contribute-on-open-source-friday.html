title: Contribute on Open Source Friday
date: 2017-06-29 00:00:00 Z
excerpt: Open Source Friday is a structured program for contributing to open source.
  Over the last three years, we've encouraged GitHub employees to take time at least
  every fourth Friday to work on open source and share what we're working on with
  each other. Open Source Friday has grown from this into a program anyone can take
  part in.
