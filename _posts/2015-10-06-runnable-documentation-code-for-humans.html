excerpt: Getting your first pull request from an outside contributor on GitHub is
  an exciting experience. Someone cared enough about the problem you were solving
  to check it out themselves, change something, and contribute that change back to
  your project. When your project has a relatively small number of high-quality, desirable
  incoming pull requests it is easy to happily merge them.
