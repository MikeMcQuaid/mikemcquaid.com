      <h3 id="_what_is_ajax">1.1. What is Ajax?</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Ajax is shorthand for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML" and is a recent
          technique for developing more interactive Web applications, allowing faster
          input and better usability, striving for similar interfaces to those provided
          by GUI desktop applications.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Figure 1 shows the main differences between a classic Web application and an
          Ajax Web application.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="figure-1" class="imageblock">
        <div class="content">

        </div>
        <div class="title">Figure 1. Comparing Ajax and classic Web application models (<em>Copyright Adaptive Path, LLC
            2005</em>)</div>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A classic Web application sends a request to a server which generates the page,
          perhaps from a database, returning a page which is then displayed in the
          client&#8217;s browser. On each new page request or the retrieval or submission of
          new data, the whole page must be re-requested from the server.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>An Ajax Web application follows the same pattern on the initial retrieval of a
          page, however, when new data needs to be sent or received from the server,
          instead of re-requesting the whole page, the browser can call a method written
          in JavaScript. JavaScript is a browser scripting language and in this case can
          be used to retrieve the data asynchronously. This data is normally returned as
          XML, which is then parsed by the JavaScript and used to modify the DOM and CSS
          of the page.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Figure 2 compares the typical interaction model between a classic Web
          application and an Ajax Web application.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="figure-2" class="imageblock">
        <div class="content">
          <img alt="ajaxinteraction" src="{{ '/images/dizzy/ajaxinteraction.png' | absolute_url }}">
        </div>
        <div class="title">Figure 2. Comparing Ajax and classic Web application client/server interaction (<em>Copyright
            Adaptive Path, LLC 2005</em>)</div>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The classic Web application requires user activity to take place then be
          submitted to the server and the data must be processed and returned
          successfully to the client before the user can commence any more interaction.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Ajax Web application allows continuous user activity. On certain events
          JavaScript functions will be run by the browser, allowing client-side
          processing of data, such as input validation. If necessary, this data can then
          be sent to the server and/or the server return more data. This usage pattern is
          closely similar to that of a GUI desktop application where the user does not
          typically have to wait for the completion of tasks and can work without
          worrying about manually initiating interaction with the "server".</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
      <h3 id="_when_is_ajax_used">1.2. When is Ajax used?</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>With increased bandwidth now available to large proportions of the first-world
          population, Web applications are becoming feasible replacements for GUI desktop
          applications. This movement is known by some as "Web 2.0". One of ideas behind
          "Web 2.0" is the Web as an application platform, replacing GUI desktop
          applications, allowing cross-platform applications and allowing data to be
          easily shared and manipulated between machines in different geographical
          localities. The only prerequisites for these applications are an Internet
          connection and a relatively modern browser.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The first wave of these applications to move online was email. There has been
          Web-based email for over 10 years and it is many users' sole way of accessing
          their email. Google&#8217;s email application, Gmail, was one of the first uses of
          Ajax technology on the Internet. For browsers that support Ajax, the user
          interface is similar to a GUI desktop application, with the ability to drag
          items and quickly open and close emails without the whole page reloading.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>With Ajax the goal of moving GUI desktop applications online may finally be
          realised. As shown in <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>, Ajax finally allowed the user of
          an Ajax Web application to have an uninterrupted workflow. This can potentially
          greatly boost their productivity, bringing it more in-line with that from GUI
          desktop applications, whilst keeping the benefits of a Web application such as
          distributed processing, no need for local backups, high up-time and portability.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Now users and developers wishing to take advantage of Ajax have many options
          available to them. For developers, many Ajax libraries are now available,
          making Ajax user interface development as simple as importing any other
          library. Users can now find Ajax applications for word processing,
          spreadsheets, picture management, email, satellite mapping and more.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
      <h3 id="_what_are_the_problems_with_ajax">1.3. What are the problems with Ajax?</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Ajax technologies, while being useful to both users and developers, are still
          in their infancy. Ajax applications frequently suffer from niggling bugs such
          as "breaking" the expected functionality of the "Back" button, causing other
          unexpected browser behaviour and may have security risks. It is also currently
          unclear whether the claimed benefits of Ajax actually result in better user
          interfaces. The role of this project is to try and discover any benefits and
          problems and see whether Ajax Web applications provide interface improvements
          over classic Web applications and existing GUI desktop applications, whilst
          having fewer disadvantages than either individual approach. A literature review
          was conducted in order to discover the need for this discussion. An existing
          classic Web application was modified into an Ajax application after critically
          evaluating the user interface failings of the existing classic Web application
          and GUI desktop application. Finally, the new Ajax Web application was
          evaluated and through this the strengths and weaknesses of Ajax were discussed.</p>

        <p>The term "Ajax" was first used in "Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications"
          &lt;<a href="#reference-2">[2]</a>&gt;, an article about interaction design. The two examples referenced as
          examples of Ajax were Google&#8217;s Suggest and Maps services.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Figure 3 shows an example of Google Suggest in progress. As search queries are

          manipulated by clicking and dragging around the map, and the map is dynamically
          loaded and updated, with no need to press reload. Also, take note of the shadow

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>These applications are an example of what Adaptive Path called Ajax. Ajax makes
          use of the manipulation of XHTML and CSS, using the DOM, by JavaScript, and
          information retrieval and manipulation using XML, XSLT, XMLHttpRequest and
          JavaScript. The information retrieval is done by regular polling of XML data
          using JavaScript, providing the interactivity not existing in classic Web
          applications.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>At the time of this article, the main users of Ajax were Google, making use of
          it on their Gmail, Groups, and the aforementioned Suggest and Maps services,
          but it also saw use in Flickr and Amazon&#8217;s A9 search engine. The article
          provided a clear explanation of both the technical usages of Ajax, its
          implementation and merits, and paved the ground for future studies in using
          Ajax for rich-client applications. Although this article was the first mention
          of Ajax, analysis of the usability of related technologies have been seen
          before, albeit with different terminology, such as DHTML.</p>

      <h3 id="_navigating_the_applet_browser_divide">2.2. Navigating the Applet-Browser Divide</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Comparable issues to those spawned by Ajax have been analysed before, such as
          in "Navigating the Applet-Browser Divide" &lt;<a href="#reference-9">[9]</a>&gt;. The feel of browser applets
          was very different to that of classic Web applications and raised similar
          usability problems to those encountered with Ajax applications. Users were
          found to instinctively press the browser&#8217;s "Back" button when intending to
          return to a previous stage in the applet process, which, if the applet had not
          taken this into consideration, wiped all progress they had undertaken so far in
          the applet, causing the user to have to start again. Again, applets brought
          claims of allowing the user to "dynamically interact with information", similar
          to those claims made today with the rise of "Web 2.0" and Ajax. This article
          contained the results from a usability study which found that users tended to
          depend on the browser navigation buttons to navigate through the applet. When
          navigation buttons were provided inside the applet the users were found to have
          fewer problems with integration and navigation. This article also highlighted
          the now so-relevant issue of ensuring compatibility between browsers.</p>

        <p>The issue with the "Back" button was further explored in "Ajax: How to Handle
          Bookmarks and Back Button" &lt;<a href="#reference-8">[8]</a>&gt; . The problem was raised by using Gmail as a
          case study. Once a user enters Gmail, at the time of publishing, the URL
          remained the same throughout the session, so if a user entered an email
          message, and then wished to leave the message and go back to the inbox by
          clicking the browser&#8217;s "Back" button, to their surprise they would find
          themselves out of Gmail.</p>

        <p>Before the term "Ajax" became popular, some of the technologies used were
          referred to as DHTML. "DHTML accessibility: solving the JavaScript
          accessibility problem" &lt;<a href="#reference-3">[3]</a>&gt; discussed some of the other issues arising from
          the usage of these technologies, focusing on the difficulty in providing
          content accessible to those with disabilities when the application relies on
          JavaScript. The main problems highlighted were dealing with focus on dynamic
          content and providing semantic data for GUIs, to allow the use of purely
          text-based input and display. It also called for a paradigm shift to ensure
          that interfaces are all usable through a keyboard interface and other assisting
          technologies, hopefully providing interfaces that can be better than the
          existing alternatives for disabled users.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>"Beyond Ajax" &lt;<a href="#reference-4">[4]</a>&gt; discussed both the potential of Ajax Web applications
          and
          their limits. The first limit shown is that Ajax applications cannot allow
          realtime event notification, instead requiring a polling loop; the more regular
          the poll, the more bandwidth and processing used, both on the client and
          server. The second limit raised is, that although most processing-intensive
          tasks can and have been made into Web applications, the GUI desktop equivalents
          provide certain advantages. An example of this is direct hardware access, which
          is not possible without browser plugins, such as Adobe&#8217;s Reader or Flash, the
          latter providing video and audio recording, with user-controllable security
          levels (see Figure 5). This paper showed some of the possible advantages of
          Ajax such as dramatic bandwidth savings in leveraging the transfer of XML using
          JavaScript rather than reloading whole pages. However, the benefits and costs
          of migrating GUI desktop applications online must be weighed up, with respect
          to security, bandwidth, response and interactivity issues.</p>

        <p>The term "Web 2.0" was first used publicly by O&#8217;Reilly Media as a name for a
          conference in 2005. It has become rather popular in technology circles,
          describing the rise in the use of Ajax and other XML technologies and also the
          growth of Web-based communities around these technologies. "Web 2.0 Next Big

          which refers to the use of Web applications attempting to behave more like
          their GUI desktop counterparts. Also, the importance of dynamic content, user
          participation, metadata and markup were raised, allowing a way for users to
          both create and find information more effectively. This article reiterated the
          previously mentioned issues accompanying Ajax technologies, such as lack of
          JavaScript availability and "breaking" the "Back" button, also the difficulty
          of bookmarking dynamically generated pages with varying states, meaning that

          to the recent growth of Ajax applications being used, forming the previously
          mentioned "Web 2.0", bringing a shift from applications (such as those on the

          to worry more about content than writing the JavaScript manually. The main
          focus of the paper was the styles for architecture of Ajax-based solutions. It
          introduced the idea that Ajax applications can be seen as a hybrid, combining
          features from GUI desktop and Web applications. This brought the conclusion
          that an architectural style must be created, rather than simply reusing
          existing desktop or Web styles. The style described in this paper is known as
          "SPIAR", and highlights the factors of intractability, latency, network
          performance, simplicity, scalability, portability and visibility in Ajax
          application design. The rest of the paper focused more on specific application

          using client-side technologies, such as Ajax, to continue to ensure the

          similar functionality and features as a GUI desktop application, but run in a
          Web browser. Ajax technologies are normally used in the creation of RIA. The
          paper posed a question, examining a different dimension of Ajax technologies,
          "why are these [<em>Ajax sites</em>] so compelling?". The reasons returned were those
          of fluid movement and immediate responses to user input, which create "engaging
          interfaces". However, the issue of Ajax becoming a development trend was
          raised. A call is made for detailed studies into user interaction with RIA,
          rather than developers to creating RIA for the sake of personal exploration and
          jumping on the latest technological bandwagon, instead trying to use RIA

          that there is a real difficulty for developers currently debating whether to

            <p>The problem consistent across the errors is a lack of indication of the

              only perform validation when the "start" button is pressed. Java&#8217;s GUI
              libraries provide facilities to manage and handle the user&#8217;s input on each
              individual field&#8217;s entry, but this is not done. Due to this the process to
              ensure data is correct is slow as only one error is thrown at a time, so if
              multiple there are multiple errors, these must be sorted one-by-one before the

              submitted the form to be evaluated. In addition, due to the redirect mechanism,
              the previous values they entered are lost on the failure of the parameter
              validation (as observed in Figure 11). The server-side mechanism proves little
              problem on high-bandwidth connections, but when either the client or the server

          <p>Rather than using Dizzy&#8217;s method of requesting a local file location for the

            The first is to manually enter the file into an editor and the second to upload
            the file. The latter will be covered in the next subsection.</p>

            with the editor is that when "Update file" is clicked the browser sends the new
            contents and the page redirects. This means that to edit the file once more the
            user must reselect the file and open the editor again.</p>

        detailed explanation of the workings of the solution. Each section also

    <div class="sect2">
      <h3 id="_feedback_for_long_running_server_side_tasks">6.1. Feedback for long-running server-side tasks</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The first step in implementing this feature was adding the necessary hooks into
          the existing parts of the Web application used to run the chemical simulations.
          This was needed as the previous method of performing simulations was by a
          blocking method called from the JSP. This was made non-blocking, and the
          progress was made available to the JSP which allowed the implementation of a
          graceful fallback method for long-running simulations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>With all Ajax applications, as there is not currently universal browser
          support, it is essential to ensure that applications fallback gracefully if the
          XMLHttpRequest object cannot be created or if JavaScript is not running on the
          browser at all. With this in mind, the progress data now available to the JSP
          pages was used to create a static page that contained the progress-bar and time
          remaining. However, for the user to be able to see the current progress of the
          run, the page has to be regularly refreshed periodically. While this is
          possible using the Meta refresh tag, it is discouraged by the W3C&#8217;s Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines &lt;<a href="#reference-12">[12]</a>&gt; as if the user is in the middle of another
          task in the Web browser, such as entering a new URL, this could be interrupted
          or lost by a page refresh. Also, as the progress page is around 3KB, with 26KB
          of other data (that can be cached), this a large amount to be periodically
          refreshed without user intervention. It was decided to simply allow the user to
          manually refresh the page, and they would be automatically redirected and
          informed on run completion. This is an improvement on the complete lack of
          progress feedback in Klingon, but far from a desirable result, as it still
          requires user interaction, unlike Dizzy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>With Ajax this user interaction is not required. A few mechanisms on the client
          and server are combined to give a transparent update of data. The first step is
          creating an XML server. A JSP file makes use of a server-side session variable
          to locate which user and run are requested and then returns an XML file
          containing the progress and the time remaining. The next step is creating the
          necessary client-side JavaScript, which is run by the browser automatically on
          the page load. This JavaScript creates the XMLHttpRequest object and sets the
          URL to asynchronously get the XML file generated by the server. Rather than
          busy-waiting on a response from the server, a callback method is set which is
          run on a change of the ready state of the XMLHttpRequest. This state progresses
          from the initial value to open, sent, receiving and finally loaded. When it is
          loaded, the callback method checks the status of the HTTP response. The XML
          server makes use of the HTTP response&#8217;s status codes to provide information
          about the status of the run; a lower bandwidth method than using XML.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The following status codes are used:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ulist">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>200 OK - This code indicates there has been a change since the last client
              progress update, and that progress data is available.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>303 See Other - This code indicates that the run has completed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>204 No Content - This code indicates that there has been no change in
              progress since the last client progress update.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The OK status code provides the progress data as XML, whereas the other two
          provide no XML content. This is slightly more complex than using a purely
          XML-based method but is more bandwidth-efficient as no XML data is transferred
          and the client does not need to respond to the server&#8217;s initial HTTP response.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>On an OK status code the callback method parses the XML provided by the server
          to obtain the progress information. This information is used to then manipulate
          the DOM and CSS of the progress page in the browser, updating the colour and
          length of the progress-bar, the progress percentage and the estimated time
          remaining. This can be seen in Figure 18.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>On a No Content status code the page is not updated, but in order to inform the
          user an update but no new progress data was available has occurred the status
          bar of the browser displays "No Update".</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Regardless of the status code, on the evaluation of the code and associated
          response, the callback method is set to run again in a one second.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>To further optimise the XML size, the XML tag names were shortened as this XML
          will not be read or downloaded other than by JavaScript.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>For example, a typical XML response with non-optimised tags might be the
          following:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="listingblock">
        <div class="content">
          <pre>&lt;progress&gt;

&lt;completed&gt;50&lt;/completed&gt;

&lt;remaining&gt;20 seconds remaining&lt;/remaining&gt;

&lt;/progress&gt;</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>After optimisation:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="listingblock">
        <div class="content">
          <pre>&lt;p&gt;&lt;c&gt;50&lt;/c&gt;&lt;r&gt;20 seconds remaining&lt;/r&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The optimised XML file is, on average, around 82 bytes. Compared with the 3KB
          minimum from the meta refresh method, it is clear that for large amounts of
          clients, or low-bandwidth connections, the Ajax method is far more efficient.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Also added to Shiny was the ability for the run to complete in the background,
          allowing the user to accomplish other tasks while the run was completed on the
          server. This was facilitated by the method of handling runs, and also the new
          progress-bar. The progress-bar code was designed to be portable, so it was
          easily embedded into the navigation bar as a small reminder of the run
          progress; this can be seen in Figure 19.</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>In event of the XMLHttpRequest object failing to be created or disabled
            JavaScript the progress will simply update whenever the user takes a navigation
            action in the browser. For instance, when they move to a new page it will
            display the latest progress in the navigation bar, as shown in Figure 19 or if
            the user simply refreshes the progress page they will see a display similar to
            Figure 18 The only difference will be a lack of animation due to the updates
            being initiated by the user rather than the server.</p>

      <h3 id="_input_validation_from_server_side_parameters">6.2. Input validation from server-side parameters</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Due to previous input validation in Klingon occurring on the server-side, there
          was no need to delve too deeply into the existing code in order to access the
          server-side parameter checking. The first step in this case was creating an XML
          server to serve the error information to the client. The previous method in
          Klingon sent the contents of the form to the server, which was validated and
          then accepted or returned with any errors. In Shiny this was handled by sending
          the output of a single input box from the form, and the unique identifier for
          the input box to the server. With Shiny this is not done on submission of the
          form but instead when the current input box loses focus, that is the user moves
          the text entry indicator to another input box.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The transmission of the value is done in much the same way as the progress
          indicator, except this time the XML server accepts the previously mentioned
          parameters and, in event of an error, produces a relevant error message. Also,
          as in the progress example, this is done by means of an XMLHttpRequest in
          JavaScript, not on direct user prompting, with HTTP status codes and XML
          optimisation again used to save bandwidth. This method, however, is not a
          regular poll, but only occurs when the user has changed the text entry
          indicator, indicating that they have finished with that field.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Figure 20 shows the results of an incorrect start time. This looks very similar
          to the results from Klingon, but there are two key differences. Firstly, the
          illegal value is still displayed. Secondly, the invalid value will be displayed
          instantly, with only 64 bytes used in the transmission of this error; Klingon&#8217;s
          method requires 6-11KB. The error messages provided are not any more helpful,
          but this was felt to be not an Ajax-related issue, and could have been fixed
          trivially. The main advantage the Shiny solution provides is the speed the use
          trial-and-error to find acceptable values, with near-instantaneous feedback
          without the removal of the invalid value.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A possible alternative to the Ajax method used in Shiny would simply be to use
          pure JavaScript to do input validation. This is discussed in
          <a href="#_input_validation_based_on_client_side_data">Input validation based on
            client-side data</a> but was not used in this case. An advantage of this method
          of server-side validation is that the input parameters are not made known to
          the user. This could be seen as a disadvantage, but it can help with two
          factors: security and flexibility.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The first benefit is that using server-side validation allows the criteria for
          input rejection to be kept secret from a client, requiring brute-force attacks
          in order to attempt to work out the acceptable range. If this were done using
          JavaScript client-side validation, the ranges could be easily determined and
          attacked more effectively. Also, if only client-side validation is used, a
          malicious client could simply disable JavaScript support in the browser and
          their input would not be subject to any validation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The other benefit comes in the handling of change. In this example, if a server
          administrator wanted to immediately change the validation ranges, or remove
          them completely, any clients who had a Webpage with the existing JavaScript
          code downloaded or cached would check the old ranges rather than the new.</p>

          redo a lengthy simulation. With Klingon, it was still necessary to for the user

          lacking in the previous PNG format. The text in an SVG file, such as chart axes
          in this case, can be searched through and copied. Using an SVG editor such as
          Inkscape, these charts can be easily modified, annotated or edited; difficult
          with a PNG file. The SVG output library used generated large SVGs (in the above
          example 44KB compared with a 12KB PNG), Thankfully this was not an issue as it
          can be compressed automatically by the Web server and client&#8217;s Web browser, as
          most modern browsers support gzip compression, after which the PNG is 11KB but
          the SVG only 3.8KB (with default compression). The added SVG functionality also

          increasing numbers concurrently. This is one of the reasons some Web browsers
          become unstable. A common problem with long-running user tasks using the Web
          browser is, on event of a crash, everything is lost.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The previous method used in Klingon of creating and editing simulator files was
          shown to be problematic. It was necessary for a user to navigate away from the
          current page, losing focus in the file, every time they wanted to make a save.
          This naturally encourages users to not navigate away, and therefore, not to
          save. More technical users may type the file up in an application that allows
          saving first, before entering it into the browser, but this is not an ideal
          solution.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The previous sections have already shown that browsers with Ajax support can
          easily send and receive information from a server asynchronously, without
          breaking the user&#8217;s workflow. For editing simulator files Shiny uses JavaScript
          to submit the contents of the editor, using a form, in the background, using
          the XMLHttpRequest object. This form data is sent to the server in exactly the
          same format as in Klingon, but this way was done behind the scenes and did not

        <p>The other way of adding files to the server is by traditional HTTP uploading.
          The previous Klingon method works satisfactorily for small uploads, but for
          larger uploads or slow Internet connections, the page will appear to hang until
          the file has finished uploading, and, as with the Klingon&#8217;s simulation runs,
          there is no indication as to how long this will take.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Klingon backend code made use of an external module to handle file uploads.
          The latest beta of this module added the ability to associate a given upload
          with a progress listener. This was used to create an XML server for the upload
          progress. When a file is sent to the server the browser informs the server of
          the number of files being sent and the size of each file. The progress listener
          can then use this information, combined with the size of file already uploaded,
          to calculate the percentage through the upload. An XMLHttpRequest object is
          used with callback objects to asynchronously poll the XML server for the file
          upload status, and display a progress-bar on the page while the file is
          uploaded. A example of an upload in progress can be seen in Figure 24.</p>

        <p>This method is less successful than the simulation run progress-bar, as
          uploading the file will make maximum use of either client or server bandwidth,
          so polling the progress from the server is far slower than with the simulation
          progress-bar, as the connection is being saturated. However, this method still
          allows a user to more easily estimate how long an upload will take and can be
          useful for large uploads.</p>

        <p>Sometimes input validation on the client-side is actually more secure and
          sensible than using a server-side method. For example, when checking password
          data over a non-secure link, it is sensible to not send the password in
          plain-text over an untrusted network. Also, for basic checks it may be a waste
          of resources relying on the server to validate data, for example checking the
          similarity of two strings.</p>

          change of a relevant input box a JavaScript function is called to check the
          validity of the input and, if necessary, modify the DOM to insert warning text.

          <p>The architecture of Klingon was carefully thought out and planned to allow
            proper, secure access to the needed underlying elements of the application
            using JavaBeans, reducing the need for the JSP to worry about the logic
            occurring in the chemical simulator, instead focusing on the UI and I/O with
            the user.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>A problem that arrives early on with developing an Ajax application, and in
            this case took a large proportion of the development time is re-engineering the
            existing system to allow the new Ajax elements of the Web application to
            present meaningful data to the client. The simulation run&#8217;s progress-bar,
            specifically required information that was previously only available in the
            lowest levels of the application, communicating directly with the logic of the
            chemical simulator. This meant that with the multi-tier architecture in place
            it became very difficult to retrieve this information cleanly for use in the
            browser. This is not a criticism of the previous code in Klingon; the
            application was designed in an efficient and secure structure, but these very
            strengths actually worked against the implementation of the Ajax feedback.
            Fundamentally Ajax relies on the user being kept up-to-date with any actions,
            and allowing the user to incrementally access the backend logic, rather than
            simply submitting a request for a lengthy operation and receiving a result, as
            with a standard Web application. As mentioned in "An Architectural Style for
            Ajax" &lt;<a href="#reference-6">[6]</a>&gt;, The approach to writing Ajax Web applications is more similar
            to
            writing a GUI desktop application with the added difficulties of multi-user
            access, security and distributed processing that occur from writing a Web
            application. Fundamentally, the strengths from both applications can be
            combined, but in order to do so an Ajax software engineer is usually also
            required to battle with the difficulties of both.</p>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>One of the main problems with all Web programming is that of cross-browser
              compatibility. Each of the main browser rendering engines (Opera, Webkit/KHTML,
              Gecko, Internet Explorer) have different quirks, their own unique features and
              bugs. In the case of Microsoft Internet Explorer, pages that render in other
              browsers perfectly frequently fail in Internet Explorer. JavaScript, sadly, is
              no different. The DOM is slightly different between browser implementations
              and, again, Internet Explorer is the main contender for problems, even with the
              latest version (Internet Explorer 7.0) failing to meet the DOM specification
              fully. Also, as mentioned earlier, Ajax makes use of CSS manipulation to style
              the page, and with the two main browsers (Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft
              Internet Explorer) failing to fully meet the CSS2 specification more
              difficulties arise.</p>

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Essentially, a truly cross platform Ajax application must be rigorously tested
              across all the main browsers and must try to detect the current running browser
              and use different code-paths depending on that browser&#8217;s quirks and bugs. For
              this reason, in Shiny, browser compatibility was only checked with the latest
              stable versions of Mozilla Firefox (2.0.0.2) and KDE&#8217;s Konqueror (3.5.6)

          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>As has been established, JavaScript code may need to be modified to work across
              different browsers. When trying to implement and test this code, where
              unexpected behaviour is found, it can be very difficult to debug. This is
              partly due to the nature of JavaScript. JavaScript is a weakly-typed
              interpreted language, and for programmers coming from strictly-typed or even
              compiled language backgrounds this can be a difficult transition. When
              JavaScript code fails in a standard browser, by default, rather than returning
              an error to the user, it simply stops executing. For example, a common
              stumbling block is trying to access a method in a DOM object that does not
              exist. This will simply cause the script to stop executing at this attempted
              method call. Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer both have
              debuggers available, but these are not shipped with the default install of the
              application and are still in continual development.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Another minor "gotcha" in JavaScript debugging is that most browsers will, like
              any Web content, attempt to cache JavaScript. This means forcing the browser to
              not use its cache or forcefully flush it every time a script is modified. This
              is easily done during development, but with large-scale Ajax applications it
              can be hard to ensure all clients have the latest version of the JavaScript
              logic needed for the application.</p>

            <p>This is a minor problem but being a interpreted language the source code for a
              JavaScript application must be fully downloaded before its execution, and
              executed dynamically inside the browser. As a result JavaScript is far slower
              than compiled languages, and logic in JavaScript will generally be far slower
              than logic executed on the server itself. Also, for large JavaScript
              applications the long download time can cause a noticeable delay in the

              As Shiny has demonstrated, JavaScript can be used to send and receive files
              from a server, connect to external URLs and perform large calculations that may
              cause the browser to lock up. With modern browsers it can be difficult to
              arbitrarily access files from disk without the user&#8217;s consent, but cookies, for
              example, may store confidential information and could be scanned, processed and
              uploaded to a server if containing any information useful to the malicious
              provider of the script. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a broad term used to
              describe some of these attacks, allowing an attacker to do anything from
              bypassing the browser&#8217;s sandbox, accessing local files in Internet Explorer, to
              stealing passwords stored in browser session cookies.</p>

        <h4 id="_svg">6.7.3. SVG</h4>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML. Their primary use is in
            vector graphics, but they can also embed raster graphics and text. These
            graphics can also be interactive and scriptable, much like traditional XHTML
            and can be embedded in browsers. They may be slightly larger than raster
            equivalents, but when using gzip compression, commonly used by both servers and
            browsers, they are almost always smaller. SVG is an open format and the
            specification maintained by the W3C.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>SVGs are promising contenders in the future development of Ajax applications.
            So much of Ajax relies on XML and JavaScript technologies, both of which can be
            easily utilised both within and dealing with SVGs. SVGs can contain JavaScript
            within the file, animation, hyperlinks and are valid parseable XML.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>Shiny has basic SVG support, allowing the export of charts to SVG format.
            However, this was intended to be more fully-formed, but sadly some of the
            current problems with SVG hampered the efforts made. Currently the main problem
            with SVG is the simple lack of complete support across browsers. Most of the
            main browsers now support SVG in some form, but none completely implement the
            SVG Full 1.2 specification, the W3Cs most comprehensive SVG specification.
            Sadly this means that using SVG in Ajax is currently fairly buggy and
            difficult. Potentially the goal for SVGs in this project was to allow each
            chart axis to be downloaded dynamically from the server when needed, however,
            this would have required more full support for JavaScript inside the SVG
            format, not seemingly possible across the browsers used. This technology is
            still in its infancy and with the growing popularity of Ajax applications, SVG
            could well see its place inside Ajax, allowing Ajax to be a serious competitor
            for applications currently implemented as Adobe Flash or applets, with the
            added animation and graphical support SVG provides.</p>

      <h3 id="_learnability_2">7.1. Learnability</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>For an application to be easily learnable it should seem to be deterministic,
          so that every user action has an obvious, expected and consistent response. For
          Shiny, as the application is being run in a Web browser, the expected response
          is for the application to behave in similar manner as other Web applications.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The newly introduced feedback for long-running tasks would not be familiar to a
          user who has never used an Ajax application, but as this merely presents
          information on progress rather than information that the user needs to process
          this does not detract from the learnability of the application. Classic Web
          applications don&#8217;t make use of extensive long-running server-side processing,
          so the progress indication could provide indication that the application hasn&#8217;t
          crashed or "broken". The presentation of the progress-bars naturally leads to
          comparison between those of GUI desktop applications performing long-running
          operations, and a user who had downloaded files from the Internet or copied
          files to removable media would be familiar with the concept of progress-bars.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The input validation may be slightly confusing to a new user as the error
          messages may seem to appear and disappear without the user noticing, causing
          confusion when they later encounter them. Classic Web and GUI desktop
          applications tend to respond to errors in forms when the form is completed
          rather than while the form is in progress. This may make an Ajax application
          slightly harder to learn, however, these provide far great response feedback
          than the previous methods used, and the error generation is predictable and
          deterministic, so after a few errors the user will quickly realise the
          difference with this type of application.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The modification of on-screen datasets (in this case, charts) without page
          reloading is also a novel concept to users experienced only with classic Web
          applications. However, this is used constantly in GUI desktop applications, so
          it may be slightly unexpected at first but should not break the flow of the
          application or the work. This applies equally with the saving of status without
          navigation (in this case the contents of a file). Were there no feedback on the
          operation the user may become confused as to why the action they took has not
          caused the traditional click-load-newpage cycle expected in a browser, but a
          status message is updated, informing the user of their last action&#8217;s result and
          success.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Ajax applications are becoming more commonplace, with sites like YouTube,
          Flickr, Facebook and Google Maps used regularly by average Web users. To a user
          unfamiliar with these applications the instant response and animated feedback
          may be initially confusing, but as the method of input is still the same as
          classic Web applications this confusion will rapidly pass, and the new Ajax
          applications provide more rapid feedback on user input and therefore a faster
          interface.</p>

    <div class="sect2">
      <h3 id="_flexibility_2">7.2. Flexibility</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A flexible application should allow the automation of routine tasks, support
          for simultaneous tasks and give the user control of the task execution.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The progress-bar introduced in Shiny allows the user to perform other tasks,
          such as editing files, whilst keeping up to date with the progress of the
          current simulation. It also allows a user to stop a current run. In addition,
          throughout the application there is automation of tasks such as repetitive form
          submission or moving back and forward to perform input validation, change a
          dataset or submit some data to the server. This allows the user&#8217;s actions to be
          preempted, providing information in less time than it would take them to
          request it traditionally. However, a problem with this method is that the user
          is not in complete control of task execution, as many of the input validation
          operations occur without any direct request from the user, merely on input.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Most Ajax applications are similar in this regard, second-guessing the users
          current task to provide shortcuts to its completion. In Shiny, due to the
          simplistic and short nature of tasks, this works well as there is only usually
          one path the user can take to complete an action but other applications may
          result in a user having to fight with the interface in order to perform a task
          in a way that was not expected by the designers of the application. In Shiny
          the interface is not made customisable to the user, but applications such as
          the Google Customised Home and Google Maps use Ajax technologies to provide
          interface customisation, as can be seen in Figure 27.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>An application&#8217;s robustness can be shown through its indication of its past,
          present and possible future states, the ability to undo errors, responsiveness
          and providing sufficient functionality to conform to user tasks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Moving a GUI desktop application to a Web browser automatically gives it a
          state-based architecture, allowing navigation between these states and a
          history indicating the user&#8217;s movement through these states. Also, with classic
          Web applications, this allows simple errors such as a misdirected click to be
          easily remedied: simply click the "Back" button. However, with Ajax
          applications this becomes more difficult. This was highlighted earlier, instead
          referring to applets, in "Navigating the Applet-Browser divide" &lt;<a href="#reference-9">[9]</a>&gt; and
          "Ajax: How to Handle Bookmarks and Back Buttons" &lt;<a href="#reference-8">[8]</a>&gt;. Users of Web
          applications instinctively press the "Back" button to try and undo an action or
          return backwards in a process. Ajax applications rely heavily on JavaScript
          running on each page, manually updating the DOM, and this information is not
          stored in the browsers history stack, meaning that moving backwards through the
          history a user of a Web application may not see what they were expecting. In
          Shiny this is relatively minor, and only clicking back to progress-bar pages
          may present some confusion, as the progress-bars simply do not appear, or
          appear to be not progressing, the latter should not be confusing to the user as
          the run has already been visibly completed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>With larger, more dynamic Ajax applications such as GMail, this presents more
          of a problem. For example, once logged in to a GMail account, a user would find
          themselves at the "Inbox". If they decide to navigate to the "All Mail" folder
          they simply click on the link on the navigation bar. However, as this is an
          Ajax application this new folder is loaded dynamically using Ajax, so the
          address bar does not change. If the user then decides to navigate backwards to
          the "Inbox", they may instinctively press the "Back" button. With limited
          testing it was seen that this did not always return to the "Inbox" sometimes
          returning to the login screen and sometimes even "breaking" the application,
          returning the confusing error seen in Figure 28. In this strange situation,
          clicking the "Forward" button again results in the same error, with the only
          way to return to the "Inbox" again being to keep pressing the "Back" button
          until the login screen is seen and logging in once more.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>As mentioned in the last chapter, Ajax solutions tend to use lots of small
          requests for data, rather than re-requesting the page. This allows Ajax
          applications to provide more responsive interfaces, both to user input and when
          changing datasets is required, as only the new data need be transferred. A
          possible criticism is that this requires bandwidth, but the total bandwidth
          used is far less when using an Ajax method than a classic Web application.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Providing the needed functionality in an Ajax application is simply a matter of
          implementation. It may require more to implement, but ultimately the sky is the
          limit as far as Ajax is concerned, as interfaces can be created that are far
          more dynamic than a classic Web application and may equal the usability of a
          GUI desktop application.</p>

        <p>Essentially, Ajax Web applications allow the creator to provide to the user a
          method of input equally as quick as a GUI desktop application and provide
          faster data transfer, due to the lighter overhead of using XML to transfer data
          than an HTML page with all the other content that is needed. This essentially
          allows the browser to not only cache the images and stylesheets for a page but
          actually some of the other content (such as navigation bars) by simply
          modifying the current page rather than reloading it in its entirety. Also
          provided is the ability for some processing of data and input validation to be
          performed on the client rather than server-side, further reducing the latency
          in making requests and bringing the speed of the application closer still to
          that of a GUI desktop application, whilst still providing the benefits of a Web
          application. With an application such as Shiny, with a powerful server
          performing the simulations, this may be far faster than using Dizzy on the
          local machine.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>As previously mentioned, SVG is a vector graphic format that can be embedded in
          Webpages. SVGs can potentially be used to create event-driven graphics and
          animations, allow dynamic retrieval, scripting and animation. It is an open
          standard, and the tools to create, view and edit SVGs are freely available,
          with both open-source and proprietary solutions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The current problem with SVG is the lack of browser support. No browser fully
          meets the latest specification and the most commonly used browser (Microsoft
          Internet Explorer) has no native SVG support. As a result, this technology does
          not have much usage on the Web, with most SVGs used for vector art offline,
          such as icons or diagrams.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>With increased support and compatibility between browsers, SVG could
          potentially allow for even more rich interfaces than Ajax alone allows, and
          Ajax can be used within SVGs for dynamic content retrieval. Furthermore, SVG,
          with its ability to be scripted and animated, could feasibly topple Adobe Flash
          as a tool for creating dynamic, animated Websites while allowing pages to be
          individually bookmarked and give a more browser-native feel to dynamic
          applications, common criticisms of Websites using Adobe Flash.</p>

          effects of Ajax on usability, such as how likely users are to attempt to use
          the "Back" and "Forward" buttons. With Shiny the changes made and added
          functionality was sufficiently small to allow guideline based evaluation to be
          sufficient, but a comparative evaluation of GMail or another Ajax version of a
          common, complicated GUI desktop application, such as a word processor or
          spreadsheet, could be beneficial, allowing developers to ensure their focus is

          Ajax applications could potentially suffer greatly compared with classic Web
          applications. Due to insufficient infrastructure available to test this
          further, this report does examine the effects under these conditions, however
          the frequent small update structure usually used in Ajax applications will
          result in a sluggish or "broken" application with poor network conditions, so a

        <p>A common criticism of the wave of Ajax applications and the increased use of

          security. Previously mentioned are the possibilities of cross-site scripting
          vulnerabilities in JavaScript but also the weakly-typed nature of JavaScript,
          the dependence on client checking the client data, the inability to prevent
          modification of the local copy of JavaScript and poor error handling all create
          potential security flaws, bringing security risks to the server and/or the
          client. A recent virus named "Yamanner" spread through the Yahoo! Mail service,

      <h3 id="_comet">8.5. Comet</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Comet is a further evolution of Ajax. Where Ajax relies on a polling loop to
          check for changes on a server and to mimic event-driven behaviour. This model
          is flawed when the client must wait for an event to occur on the server, as it
          relies on the client checking for the event before it can be handled or
          detected. A better solution to this problem would be allowing the server to
          notify the client on the event, but this is not possible with Ajax. Comet is a
          technique that, rather than using a polling loop keeps a consistent HTTP
          connection between client and server, allowing the server to send data to the
          client on an event without the client requesting it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Comet was, at the planning stages of this project, very much a bleeding-edge
          technology. During this project more frameworks have become available and Comet
          is becoming a viable option for event-based user interfaces. Some of the
          concerns still remaining with Comet are on its scalability, with each client
          requiring a long HTTP connection to the server, and existing Web servers are
          not designed for such a large number of connections.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Shiny&#8217;s progress feedback relied on the client checking for new data from the
          server, and sometimes it would not be available. With Comet this could have
          occurred whenever the server had new data, rather than the client unnecessarily
          polling, resulting in lower bandwidth usage and also a more smooth progress
          indication mechanism.</p>

        <p>Ajax applications, due to the nature of their interaction with the server, can
          provide a far more responsive and rich user interface. Users can now drag and
          drop items, be notified on server events without requesting, and transform
          datasets on the fly without the need to reload the page. Their input can be
          quickly regulated and automatically corrected, minimising the use of bandwidth.
          Lengthy interactions with the server can have their progress indicated, whilst
          allowing other tasks to continue, allowing better multitasking.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The application developer can benefit through the ability to offload some of
          the application logic and processing to the client and needing to send only
          required data, rather than repeatedly send the same stylistic information.
          Also, the creation of these applications becomes increasingly less complex with
          the addition of new Ajax libraries to aid the developer.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>One of the biggest struggles with Ajax development are the difficulties arising
          from the use of JavaScript. JavaScript suffers from its weak-typing, security
          risks and different implementations across browsers and also that some users
          may have disabled JavaScript within their browsers. In addition, debugging can
          be very difficult and time consuming as Ajax applications frequently make use
          of multithreaded JavaScript, resulting in race conditions and obscure bugs. For
          logic implementation, JavaScript, as an interpreted language, is frequently
          slow and can use a lot of memory, leaving client machines somewhat
          unresponsive. In addition, the nature of an application in a browser means that
          other potentially "buggy" sites may crash the browser and cause loss of work by
          the user. A minor issue is that of retaining backwards compatibility. An Ajax
          application must be accessible to clients without JavaScript, those with
          text-based browsers or search engines.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Ajax&#8217;s lack of browser compatibility is evident from the need for "hacks" to
          make the same code work in different browsers and how easily Ajax applications
          "break" common functionality such as the "Back" button. This leads onto an
          argument growing somewhat less valid now; Ajax applications are unfamiliar to a
          user of classic Web applications and can cause confusion.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The largest development pitfall encountered in the development of Shiny was the
          difference in architecture between Ajax and classic Web applications. With Ajax
          applications, the logic needs to be easily manipulated and accessed by the Ajax
          code, and long running tasks buried deep within an application need to be made
          accessible to a user interface, necessitating large amounts of re-engineering
          in order to access this.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="_contribution">9.4. Contribution</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>This report has provided a glimpse into some of the usability benefits and
          drawbacks of Ajax Web applications. The usability study provided between Dizzy,
          Klingon and Shiny could be used to evaluate moving a classic Web application or
          GUI desktop application onto the Web. For creating new Web applications, Ajax
          can be a powerful tool in providing more usable, intuitive and responsive user
          interfaces. However, porting existing Web applications to Ajax could prove to
          be very time consuming and difficult and therefore must be analysed carefully
          before implementation. There are no clear benefits of Ajax application
          interfaces over those GUI desktop applications, but the benefits of distributed
          storage, computing and portability can be counted in the favour of Ajax.
          Technologies such as SVG and Comet are likely to push the boundaries for these
          applications even further.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Ajax is a new technology that has captured the imagination of many application
          developers. The dream of the Internet as an application platform may be
          realised and as browser support and libraries make development easier and users
          become more familiar with the new interfaces, Ajax Web applications will
          provide more services to users in an easy-to-use manner from anywhere with an
          Internet connection, without the requirement of a plug-in.</p>
