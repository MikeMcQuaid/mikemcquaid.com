title: Bootstrapping gem.coop Governance
---

[gem.coop](https://gem.coop) was announced on Monday.
As part of that announcement it was mentioned that I was helping
[gem.coop](https://gem.coop)
set up
[a governance process](https://github.com/gem-coop/governance/pull/1),
continuing the work I'd first started helping with
[on RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/pull/61).

I think it speaks well of the gem.coop maintainers that they brought me on board given I’ve:

- never contributed to RubyGems (or even created my own gem)
- been [publicly critical of André's leadership](https://www.404media.co/how-ruby-went-off-the-rails/)
- previously tried to act as a neutral mediator between RubyCentral and RubyGems maintainers

Unfortunately, how things went down initially with RubyCentral signalled the need for two things:

- a written, democratic and formal governance process (to provide a clear decision-making framework)
- financial transparency (to provide accountability on where money comes from and goes to)

To help ensure decisions are community-led and finances transparent, gem.coop now has
[gem.coop/governance](https://github.com/gem-coop/governance) and
[gem.coop's OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/gem-coop).
I was an administrator on both to bootstrap these structures and have now stepped back.

I had planned to stay involved through the first round of community voting,
but given [the wider situation](https://justin.searls.co/links/2025-10-09-people-jumped-to-conclusions-about-this-rubygems-thing/)
I felt it was best to withdraw earlier.

I remain proud of the governance work completed so far.
More community-driven governance and financial transparency in open source can only be a good thing.

I wish everyone involved the best in finding a constructive path forward for, and this time with, the wider Ruby community.
