### Mike McQuaid

#### Principal Engineer

I am a product-focused engineer who loves making software developers more efficient through my work on improving developer productivity through work on developer tools, open source software, developer experience and developer relations.

**I work from home in Edinburgh, Scotland and will never consider moving or commuting to another city, sorry!**

### Experience

Optimised setup of the GitHub.com Rails monolith saving ~375 developer hours a week (or: at least 9 engineers 40-hour work weeks). [Sunset GitHub Jobs](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-19-deprecation-notice-github-jobs-site/) and provided a framework for sunsetting other, underused GitHub features.
